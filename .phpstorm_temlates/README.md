# PHP Storm IDE templates

**If you use PHP Storm you can import these settings to automate:**
- Routes creation
- Controller creation
- Service creation
- Task creation
- Getters and Setters creation

**Notes:**
- Only templates will be imported. All other settings should stay the same.
- I suggest you to create current PHP Storm settings backup before importing my examples.
